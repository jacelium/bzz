Hooks up a Mastodon post to any API that can receive calls from Python.

Just look at the config section and the parse/act methods. I've tried to make them pretty obvious!

# TODO
- Proper configuration!
- Proper encapsulation! (Objectify that sucka)
- Better examples!
- Formatting on the sample post display in-terminal
- Checking if the specified post is 'closed' and ignoring inputs if so. For now you just have to remember to turn the script off!
