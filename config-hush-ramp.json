This post is now driving a Hush plug, which is seated snugly inside me.\n\n * For every bzz this gets, you can increase the intensity by up to 30% based on 1-3 Zs!\n * And adding intensity will also add 20s to the time the current level will be maintained.\n * But for every 5s with no new intensity boosts, it'll gradually decay by 5%.\n\nThe goal is to keep me squirming uninterruptedly as long as possible! Afterwards, there'll be some stats because I'm silly. :>",
